        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I was born and raised in San Diego, CA. I graduated from CSU California Polytechnic 
            State University, San Luis Obispo in 2023 with a BS in Statistics and cross-disciplinary
            studies minor in Data Science. I am a former AmeriCorps VISTA member in Albuquerque,
            NM in the Mayor's Office with the Office of Civic Engagement. My previous role was to
            build professional relationships with the volunteer coordinators of public safety 
            departments, build the volunteer capacity of the departments, and ensure the proper use 
            of the One Albuquerque Volunteers website.

            <br>
            <br>
            Now, I am a Bridge Operator for the Real Time Crime Center in Albuquerque, NM under the 
            Albuquerque Police Department. My new role involves providing relevant real-time information
            to officers as they take calls for service. This position allows me to utilize the problem-solving 
            and critical-thinking skills necessary for work in the public safety and law enforcement fields. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I also recently started a data-service business with a friend, Transcend Analytics, LLC. Our
            business aims to provide other businesses with solutions to make better use of their time and
            data.
